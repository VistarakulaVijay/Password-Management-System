Features
The entire program is authenticated with one Global Password - so you don't have to remember individual passwords of your accounts, just remember one - and we'll take care of the rest.
Added security - each action you do, such as deleting an account - will require your global password so that no one can misuse your data while it's running.
Each entry has an option to enter Account Name, Username, and Password.
Double encrpytion - the data files, and passwords are encrypted twice in unique algorithms making your data extra secure.
Unlock/Lock Session - Tired of re-entering your global password each time you want to decrypt data? Just unlock the current session and we won't ask for your global password while the session is unlocked. You can lock the session again by just the tap of a button. (or close the program altogether)
Copy Password - Password too lengthy or complicated to type? Just tap the Copy Password button and we'll copy it to your clipboard.

# Source Code
The entire source code of the program is stored under the "raw" folder. That's it!
